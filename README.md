# AlgoGames: play games with code

[AlgoGames](https://algogames.ai/) is a passion project that we have been working on for about a year now.

From our about page: 

"Because we like games, problem-solving, and programming, we enjoy using code to optimize gameplay. In doing so, we have found that the overhead of writing game logic is a buzzkill. With AlgoGames, we hope to remove that roadblock and provide a space for like-minded people to collaborate and compete in the pursuit of optimal decision-making."

We have zero web development experience, so any feedback would be greatly appreciated. We use Python's Django for the backend and C# .NET for game engines, both of which run in a docker container. On the front end we just use vanilla HTML and Javascript, while using SCSS for styling.

## What we have
- ### Games
    - Snake, Duel Snakes, Chess
- ### Scalable Architecture
    - We have been building our site with many more games in mind. Now that the foundations exist, it _should_ be easy to plug in new game engines.
- ### Replay Viewing
    - After a game is played, we make it available to the public to watch


## What we want (and could use guidance on)
- ### More Games!
	- Go, Texas Hold 'em Poker, Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe (what else?)
- ### Data API
	- Create an API that allows users to retrieve game data in a digestible format to make machine learning more accessible 
- ### Support for Other Languages
	- What languages do people want to program algos with?
- ### Live Game Functionality
	- Users should be able to play with and view algos in real time (websockets?)
	- Notification system: games finishing, setting up lobbies with friends, etc. (websockets?)
- ### More secure foreign code execution
	- We have securities in place, but are always nervous about running other people's code


## Repo

This repo contains example algos for the games currently on [AlgoGames](https://algogames.ai/). Feel free to copy them, use them as inspiration, or start from scratch.
